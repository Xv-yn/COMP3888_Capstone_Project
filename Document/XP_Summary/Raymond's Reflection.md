# Extreme Programming (XP) – Summary

## What is XP?  
Extreme Programming (XP) is an **agile software development methodology** designed to improve software quality and responsiveness to change. It focuses on **customer satisfaction**, **team collaboration**, and **frequent delivery** of working software through small, incremental releases.  

XP encourages simple design, automated testing, and constant feedback so that teams can adapt quickly to evolving requirements.

## Core Practices  
- **Pair Programming**: two developers work together at one workstation for better quality and knowledge sharing.  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: write tests before writing the code to ensure correctness.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: integrate code frequently, with automated builds and tests.  
- **Small Releases**: release software often to get customer feedback early.  
- **Collective Code Ownership**: all developers can change any part of the code.  
- **Sustainable Pace (40-hour week)**: avoid burnout and maintain productivity.  
- **Refactoring**: continuously improve the code design without changing its behaviour.  
- **Planning Game**: customers set priorities, developers estimate effort, and together they plan iterations.

## XP Roles  

| Role | Key Responsibilities |
|------|----------------------|
| **Customer (On-Site)** | Provides user stories, prioritises features, defines acceptance tests, gives feedback. |
| **Programmer (All team members)** | Implements features, writes unit tests, practices pair programming, maintains CI. |
| **Tracker** | Tracks project progress, compares estimates vs actuals, informs planning. |
| **Coach** | Ensures XP practices are followed, mentors team, helps solve process issues. |
| **Tester** | Works with customer on acceptance tests, validates stories, manages test suites. |
| **Manager** | Coordinates resources, protects the team, ensures delivery. |
| **Other roles (course-specific)** | Doomsayer (risk spotting), Integration/Usability Testers, Report Writer, Demo & Poster Lead, GitHub Experts, Researchers. |

## Artifacts  
- **User Stories**: short, clear requirements written from the user’s perspective (eg "As a farmer, I want to see cattle feeding time so I can monitor health").  
- **Engineering Tasks**: technical steps that implement a story, small enough to finish in a few hours.  
- Both are tracked as **GitHub issues** with acceptance criteria.

## Why XP Matters  
XP helps the team:  
- Build the **right product** by keeping the customer closely involved.  
- Maintain **high quality** through testing, CI, and refactoring.  
- Deliver **value early and often** with small, working releases.  
- Foster a **collaborative, sustainable culture** where everyone shares responsibility.
